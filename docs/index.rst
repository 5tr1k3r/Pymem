Welcome to Pymem
================

Welcome to Pymem's documentation. This documentation is divided into different
parts. You should start by reading :ref:`installation`, and then head over to
the :ref:`quickstart`. Still, you can have a look to the :ref:`tutorial`
section that shows different usage of Pymem.

Pymem depends on `pyfasm <http://github.com/srounet/pyfasm>`_ and in it's
current version does not supports x64.
